# Node.js Port Already in Use Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js development: the `EADDRINUSE` error, which occurs when a server attempts to bind to a port that is already in use by another process.

The `bug.js` file contains code that will throw this error. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to handle this error gracefully.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

## Running the Code

Run `bug.js` to see the error. Then run `bugSolution.js` to see the error handling in action.
